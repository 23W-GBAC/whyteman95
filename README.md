Title: Unraveling Text's Secrets: Beginning the Sentiment Analysis Odyssey

Chapter 1: Setting the Stage

Greetings, fellow curious minds! Today marks the commencement of an enthralling expedition into the realm of text processing and sentiment analysis using Python. As an aspiring programmer, the allure of deciphering the emotions embedded within text has led me to embark on this captivating journey. Knowing quite well that the best way to learn Programming/coding is to embark on practical projects, I’ll be using this project as I way of learning python from a beginner’s view point. Join in this exploration

The Quest for Understanding

Text—so simple in appearance, yet laden with intricate layers of meaning and sentiment—holds untold stories waiting to be unveiled. With Python as my trusty companion, I am setting out to unravel these narratives, to understand not just what is written but also how it is felt.

Preparation and Tools

Before setting sail into this captivating world, I've equipped myself with the fundamental tools Python offers for text processing and sentiment analysis. Libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and TextBlob are like treasure chests filled with linguistic gems, waiting for an explorer to discover their potential. Also, I will make use of IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset and chatGPT for clearer explanation of events and Guidiance

Understanding the Landscape: Text Processing

My first port of call in this expedition is text processing. Understanding the structure of text, breaking it down into its constituent parts, and transforming it into a format that computers can comprehend is crucial. From tokenization to stemming and lemmatization, these processes are akin to deciphering the ancient runes of language.
